##Explain dynamic and static polymorphism.

Dynamic (run time) polymorphism is the polymorphism existed at run-time. Here, Java compiler does not understand which method is called at compilation time. Only JVM decides which method is called at run-time. Method overloading and method overriding using instance methods are the examples for dynamic polymorphism.


Static (compile time) polymorphism is the polymorphism exhibited at compile time. Here, Java compiler knows which method is called. Method overloading and method overriding using static methods; method overriding using private or final methods are examples for static polymorphism
