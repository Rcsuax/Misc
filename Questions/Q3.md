##What is a ternary operator? 

A ternary operator let's you assign a value to a variable based on a boolean expression â€” either a boolean field, or a statement that evaluates to a boolean result.

It can be used as an alternative to the if/then/else syntax but it can be used many things beyond that.
####example
<pre><code>
result = testCondition ? value1 : value2
Boolean result = (a < b) ?  true : false
</code></pre>
