##Explain an object, class and method with examples.

A class is a blueprint for creating different objects.

A class can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object.

Class objects exhibit the properties and behaviors defined by its class.
<pre><code>
public class Cube {
	  //Defines properties of Cube
	int length = 10;
	int breadth = 10;
	int height = 10;
	//Defines behaviour of Cube
	public int getVolume() {
		return (length * breadth * height);
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Cube cubeObj; // Creates an instance of Cube
		
		cubeObj = new Cube(); // Creates an Object of Cube
		
		System.out.println("Volume of Cube is : " + cubeObj.getVolume());
}
}
</code><pre>
