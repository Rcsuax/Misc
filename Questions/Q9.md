##Define a constructor and what are the various types of constructors?

Constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object.

Constructors are invoked at the time of object creation. It provides data for the object.
There are  two rules defined for the constructor:
* Constructor name must be same as its class name
* Constructor must have no explicit return type

N.B If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.

There are two types of constructors: Default and parameterized.

Default constructors provides the default values to the object like 0, null etc. depending on the type.

Parameterized constructors is used to provide different values to the distinct objects.
