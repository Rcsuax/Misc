When I look at computers i dont just see a interface or an eletronic "box". I see the hours of sweat and tears of work behind it. I see the artistic genius needed to design and create every component and i am intruiged by the theory of computing. I am keen to further my knowledge in computer science.
Studying maths and computing led has increased interest in alogrithmcally solving problems and increased my desire to know more about this subject.

Furthermore i have a years experience from my apprenticeship in the tech industry working at an award winning tech start up named secret escapes where i worked as a developer and also provided technical/programmatic support. This gave me not only an amazing insight into a company that is at the forefront of the travel computing industry but it also confirmed that computing is what i love. I am familiar with Groovy,Java and Javascript programming languages which i have had to use over the past year to develop features/applications and write scripts for technical support. And i have also learnt about the software development lifecycle,testing methodolgy and the most intresting to me would be software design methodologys such as gang of four design patterns and much of the patterns mentioned in the book effective Java by Joshua Bloch.
