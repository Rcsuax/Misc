In a modern world where technology is creative and limited only by your imagination having both a creative yet logical mind is vital, i am applying to study computing to pursue a career that utilises the creativity of computer science and i am eager to build upon my current skills to improve to a more advanced level.

There are four reasons why i'm applying to study computing. First is the sheer joy of making things, programming is an art that produces visible results and it appeals greatly to my artistic side. Second is the satisfaction of making things useful to people. Fulfulling work to me is being able to help make others lifes easier through my work. Third is that computing appeals to my logical side, solving complex issues by creating many interlocking, puzzle-like moving parts is immensly fascinating. Fourth would be the joy of learning. Everyday comes with a different challenge and with every challenge i learn something new.

After studying computer science at AS level i made the decision to take an apprenticeship as a web developer to which would allow me to experince computer science in the real world. I have a years experince working for a company named secret escapes developing features and providing technical and programmatic support. In my workplace i used Groovy,Java and Javascript programming languages on a day to day basis. One of the most important take aways from my apprenticeship would be that i learned to think logically, and i learned to problem solve and i believe these skills will be my key to achieving success within university. As part of my apprenticeship
i passed several exams which tested me on the core concepts of computer science and software development and i believe that these alongside my programming experince provides me a strong base on which to start my degree
